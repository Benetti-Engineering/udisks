LOCALIZATION
============

Historically, UDisks has always had close ties with the GNOME Project, with
gvfs-udisks2-volume-monitor providing additional logic and facing the UI.
It is therefore beneficial to have both projects translated in a central
location for consistency.

UDisks leverages the GNOME Project Translation Platform. The udisks l10n module
is linked to our GitHub repository, and translations are automatically
synchronized both ways.

To contribute translations, please use the GNOME translation platform
linked above.
